>
> 1) Create the chare array(8x8).
>
> 2) Generate 10,000 random (x,y) points s.t. x and y lie b/w 0 and 1.
>
> 3) Send the points to their respective chare as was told.
>
> 4) Do a little shift in x and y coordinates by 1/100 size of box on
> both sides randomly.
>
> 5) Assuming the chare array to be a torus, reassign the points.
>
> 6) Do this for 100 time steps.
